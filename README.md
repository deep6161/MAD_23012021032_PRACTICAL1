# Practical 1: Kotlin Programming Concepts

This repository contains a series of Kotlin programs developed to demonstrate various fundamental programming concepts. Each program addresses a specific problem, from basic variable handling to more complex topics like object-oriented programming and data structures.

## 1.1. Store & Display Values in Different Variables

This program demonstrates how to declare and display values for different data types, including `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Char`, `Boolean`, and `String`.

## 1.2. Type Conversion

This program showcases various type conversion operations, specifically converting an `Integer` to a `Double`, a `String` to an `Integer`, and a `String` to a `Double`.

## 1.3. Scan and Display Student Information

This program prompts the user to input student details such as name, roll number, branch, class, batch, college, university, and age, then displays all the collected data.

## 1.4. Check Odd or Even Numbers

This program determines whether a number entered by the user is odd or even using a simple control flow statement within a `println()` method.

## 1.5. Display Month Name

This program uses a `when` expression to display the corresponding month name based on a numerical input from the user.

## 1.6. User-Defined Functions for Arithmetic Operations

This program defines a user-defined function to perform and display the results of various arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## 1.7. Factorial Calculation with Recursion

This program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

## 1.8. Working with Arrays

This program explores various array operations including printing arrays using `Arrays.deepToString()`, `contentDeepToString()`, and `IntArray.joinToString()`. It also demonstrates array manipulation using different loop types (`range`, `downTo`, `until`) and includes sorting an array both manually and with built-in functions.

## 1.9. Find Maximum Number from ArrayList

This program finds the maximum number from an `ArrayList` of integers.

## 1.10. Class and Constructor Creation

This program defines a `Car` class with properties and a constructor. It includes functions to manage car information, calculate prices, and display car details.

## 1.11. Operator Overloading and Matrix Operations

This problem explains the concept of operator overloading and implements matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication using a `Matrix` class. It also overloads the `toString()` function for customized output.
